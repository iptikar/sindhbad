Dear Mr. Abid Al-mansoori

First is all thank you for reading this report. As I have explain form the first point please go through the all the documentation that I have given to you, I never write that I will do something in 1 months, I can remember and everything is written on the paper please go through the paper and you will find out the I never promise and wrong tings to you or to anybody.

First documentation is on your desk and second that I have given to you every things is written there when and what I am going to publish. If I keep these kind of mind where I tell and don't do then that is sure I can not do this job but unfortunately I am not that and never told you untrue things. I never said I will do something in 1 months and I took many months.

I said 2 experiences guy Front end and back end minimum 2 months for first phase of seller account with front end.

Let move for another things what we have to do know. As I have explained about next buyer account will take exactly same time as seller account and which is 2 months and 1st September 2018 and it's always like two people and it's not easy to find another guy, that is why I am working alone for a while. Like I said finding right people takes time and if you find that is really your luck as well.


What is need for next process 

When I came to take to you a months ago I said I need 7500 AED for this project. You said to me I can not give right know this but if you start and work around 2, 3 months then I will see how it is possible to do the job. So I did not walked away, rather even I struggle to do the job by my self not because of my weakness but strange. Yes I always want to work with you not with my weakness but my strange then only you can get something from me for you business otherwise it's can be really difficult to get something.
