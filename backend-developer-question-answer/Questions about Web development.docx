Questions about Web development:

Why first-party cookies and third-party cookies are treated so differently?
How would you manage Web Services API versioning?

A third-party cookie is a cookie set by (and on) a domain name that is not the domain name that appears in the browser address bar. It might be set as part of a side resource load (image, JS, iframe, etc. from a different hostname) or an AJAX HTTP request to a third-party server.
A first-party cookie, on the other hand, is a cookie set by the domain name that appears in the browser address bar.

Once a cookie is set, it can always and only be read by the domain that has set it. It does not depend on if the cookie was set as a first or a third-party.
Reading a cookie as third-party is always possible (as long as it's on your domain) while setting a cookie as a third-party is sometimes disallowed.
