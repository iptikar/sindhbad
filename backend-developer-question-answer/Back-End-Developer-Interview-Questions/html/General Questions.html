<pre class="western"><b>Why does Functional Programming matter? When
should a functional programming language be used?</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Functional
languages use a different paradigm than imperative and
object-oriented languages. They use side-effect-free functions as a
basic building block in the language. ... So most people never got
more out of functional programming than calculating a single output
from a single input.</span></i></pre>

overhead?</b></pre>

<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">I believe,
generally speaking, that opening a TCP connection is considered
expensive when compared to the ability to reuse already open
connections by keeping it open. You are correct, opening a connecting
will take only 3 packets/turns, but that time - 3 x your RTT - is far
beyond the cost of reusing an already open connection, which is far
closer to 0. The disparity grows even faster if you're opening and
closing connections frequently.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">You are
certainly correct though, when compared to the number of turns you're
going to see as the application &quot;does it's thing,&quot; those 3
packets can seem pretty small, but again, it depends on how you want
to compare the options AND how your application behaves/how many
times you plan on opening a connection.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Edit If
we're talking UDP vs. TCP though, Cheekaleek here is 100% correct -
the overhead of is massive in the long term when compared to the
connectionless operations of UDP</span></i></pre>

its easy maintainability through encapsulation. ... Encapsulation is
also useful in hiding the data(instance variables) of a class from an

<pre class="western"><b>Immutability is the practice of setting
values once, at the moment of their</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><b>creation, and never changing them. How can
immutability help write safer code?</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Both
mutable and immutable objects have their own uses, pros and cons.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Immutable
objects do indeed make life simpler in many cases. They are
especially applicable for value types, where objects don't have an
identity so they can be easily replaced. And they can make concurrent
programming way safer and cleaner (most of the notoriously hard to
find concurrency bugs are ultimately caused by mutable state shared
between threads). However, for large and/or complex objects, creating
a new copy of the object for every single change can be very costly
and/or tedious. And for objects with a distinct identity, changing an
existing objects is much more simple and intuitive than creating a
new, modified copy of it.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Think about
a game character. In games, speed is top priority, so representing
your game characters with mutable objects will most likely make your
game run significantly faster than an alternative implementation
where a new copy of the game character is spawned for every little
change.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Moreover,
our perception of the real world is inevitably based on mutable
objects. When you fill up your car with fuel at the gas station, you
perceive it as the same object all along (i.e. its identity is
maintained while its state is changing) - not as if the old car with
an empty tank got replaced with consecutive new car instances having
their tank gradually more and more full. So whenever we are modeling
some real-world domain in a program, it is usually more
straightforward and easier to implement the domain model using
mutable objects to represent real-world entities.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Apart from
all these legitimate reasons, alas, the most probable cause why
people keep creating mutable objects is inertia of mind, a.k.a.
resistance to change. Note that most developers of today have been
trained well before immutability (and the containing paradigm,
functional programming) became &quot;trendy&quot; in their sphere of
influence, and don't keep their knowledge up to date about new tools
and methods of our trade - in fact, many of us humans positively
resist new ideas and processes. &quot;I have been programming like
this for nn years and I don't care about the latest stupid fads!&quot;</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><b>What are the pros and cons of mutable and
immutable values.</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Many
functional languages are non pure (allow mutation and side effects).</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">f# is for
example, and if you look at some of the very low level constructs in
the collections you'll find that several use iteration under the hood
and quite a few use some mutable state (if you want to take the first
n elements of a sequence it's so much easier to have a counter for
example).</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">The trick
is that this is something to generally:</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Use
sparingly</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Draw
attention to when you do</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">note how in
f# you must declare something to be mutable</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">That it is
possible to largely avoid mutating state is evidenced by the large
amount of functional code out there. For people brought up on
imperative languages this is somewhat hard to get your head round,
especially writing code previously in loops as recursive functions.
Even trickier is then writing them, where possible, as tail
recursive. Knowing how to do this is beneficial and can lead to far
more expressive solutions that focus on the logic rather than the
implementation. Good examples are those that deal with collections
where the 'base cases' of having no, one or many elements are cleanly
expressed rather than being part of the loop logic.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">It is
really 2 though that things are better. And this is best done via an
example:</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Take your
code base and change every instance variable to readonly[1][2].
Change back only those ones where you need them to be mutable for
your code to function (if you only set them once outside the
constructor consider trying to make them arguments to the constructor
rather than mutable via something like a property.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">There are
some code bases this will not work well with, gui/widget heavy code
and some libraries (notably mutable collections) for example but I
would say that most reasonable code will allow over 50% of all
instance fields to be made readonly.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">At this
point you must ask yourself, &quot;why is mutable the default?&quot;.
Mutable fields are in fact a complex aspect of your program as their
interactions, even in a single threaded world, have far more scope
for differing behaviour; as such they are best highlighted and drawn
to the attention of the coder rather than left 'naked' to the ravages
of the world.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">It is
notable that most functional languages have either no concept of null
or make it very hard to use because they work, not with variables,
but with named values whose value is defined at the same time (well
scope) the name is.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">I find it
unfortunate that c# did not copy java's concept of immutability with
local variables too. Being able to assert emphatically that something
doesn't change helps make intent clear whether a value is on the
stack or in an object/struct.</span></i></pre>

<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">HTTP is a
protocol used mostly for browsing the internet (IE, Firefox, etc). It
rides on top of TCP which provides a reliable link between two
computers (if packet get lost - it is re-transmitted). TCP itself
rides on top of IP, which provides unified addressing to communicate
between computers. TCP/IP is a basis for internet and 99% of other
networks.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Basically
it means if you are communicating HTTP, you are doing it with TCP/IP
underneath (but I am sure this is not what your professor meant).</span></i></pre>

unusual option is to attach Nano to your Android smartphone using
