<pre class="western"><b>How would you migrate an application from a
database to another, for example from MySQL to PostgreSQL? If you had
to manage that project, which issues would you expect to face?</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">My
experience with MySQL -&gt; Postgresql migration wasn't really
pleasant, so I'd have to second Daniel's suggestion about CSV files.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">In my case,
I recreated the schema by hands and then imported all tables,
one-by-one, using mysqldump and pg_restore.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">So, while
this dump/restore may work for the data, you are most likely out of
luck with schema. I haven't tried any commercial solutions, so see
what other people say and... good luck!</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">UPDATE: I
looked at the code the process left behind and here is how I actually
did it.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">I had a
little different schema in my PostgreSQL db, so some tables were
joined, some were split. This is why straightforward import was not
an option and my case is probably more complex than what you describe
and this solution may be an overkill.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">For each
table in PG database I wrote a query that selects the relevant data
from MySQL database. In case the table is basically the same in both
databases, and there are no joins it can be as simple as this</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">select *
from mysql_table_name</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Then I
exported results of this query to XML, to do this you need to run it
like this:</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">echo
&quot;select * from mysql_table_name&quot; | mysql [CONNECTION
PARAMETERS] -X --default-character-set=utf8 &gt; mysql_table_name.xml</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">This will
create a simple XML file with the following structure:</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">&lt;resultset
statement=&quot;select * from mysql_table_name&quot;&gt;</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western">  <i><span style="font-weight: normal">&lt;row&gt;</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western">    <i><span style="font-weight: normal">&lt;field
name=&quot;some_field&quot;&gt;field_value&lt;/field&gt;</span></i></pre>

<pre class="western">  <i><span style="font-weight: normal">...</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">&lt;/resultset&gt;</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Then, I
wrote a script, that produces INSERT statement for each row element
in this XML file. The name of the table, where to insert the data was
given as a command line parameter to this script. Python script, in
case you need it.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">These sql
statements were written to a file, and then fed to psql like this:</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">psql
[CONNECTION PARAMETERS] -f FILENAME -1</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">The only
trick there was in XML -&gt; SQL transformation is to recognize
numbers, and unquote them.</span></i></pre>

up: mysql can produce query results as XML and you can use it.</span></i></pre>

properties.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>

<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Atomicity
means that you can guarantee that all of a transaction happens, or

all or nothing, and a crash, power failure, error, or anything else
won't allow you to be in a state in which only some of the related
changes have happened.</span></i></pre>

means that you guarantee that your data will be consistent; none of
the constraints you have on related data will ever be violated.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Isolation
means that one transaction cannot read data from another transaction
that is not yet completed. If two transactions are executing
concurrently, each one will see the world as if they were executing
sequentially, and if one needs to read data that is written by
another, it will have to wait until the other is finished.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Durability
means that once a transaction is complete, it is guaranteed that all
of the changes have been recorded to a durable medium (such as a hard
disk), and the fact that the transaction has been completed is
likewise recorded.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">So,
transactions are a mechanism for guaranteeing these properties; they
are a way of grouping related actions together such that as a whole,
a group of operations can be atomic, produce consistent results, be
isolated from other operations, and be durably recorded.</span></i></pre>

<pre class="western"><b>How is Lazy Loading achieved? When is it
useful? What are its pitfalls?</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Lazy
loading is a design pattern commonly used in computer programming to
defer initialization of an object until the point at which it is
needed. It can contribute to efficiency in the program's operation if
properly and appropriately used. The opposite of lazy loading is
eager loading.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">It's called
lazy loading because, like a lazy person, you are putting off doing
something you don't want to. The opposite is Eager Loading, where you
load something right away, long before you need it.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">If you are
curious why people might use lazy loading, consider an application
that takes a LOOOOONG time to start. This application is probably
doing a lot of eager loading... loading things from disk, and doing
calculations and whatnot long before it is ever needed.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Compare
this to lazy loading, the application would start much faster, but
then the first time you need to do something that requires some long
running load, there may be a slight pause while it is loaded for the
first time. Thus, with lazy loading, you are amortizing the load time
throughout the course of running your application... and you may
actually save from loading things that the user may never intend to
use.</span></i></pre>

<pre class="western"><b>The so called &quot;N + 1 problem&quot; is an
issue that occurs when the code needs to load the children of a
parent-child relationship with a ORMs that have lazy-loading enabled,
and that therefore issue a query for the parent record, and then one
query for each child record. How to fix it?</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">The N + 1
problem is a performance anti-pattern in which an application makes N
+ 1 database calls (where N is the number of objects fetched). Like
most antipatterns, this isn’t necessarily a problem in itself, but
under certain circumstances (where N is large, for example) it will
cause performance to degrade by making hundreds or even thousands of
database calls for a single business transaction.</span></i></pre>

database normalization? When is it advisable to use denormalized
databases?</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Denormalization
is a time-space trade-off. Normalized data takes less space, but may
require join to construct the desired result set, hence more time. If
it's denormalized, data are replicated in several places. It then
takes more space, but the desired view of the data is readily
available.</span></i></pre>

<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Pros and
Cons of a Normalized database design.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Normalized
databases fair very well under conditions where the applications are
write-intensive and the write-load is more than the read-load. This
is because of the following reasons:</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Normalized
tables are usually smaller and have a smaller foot-print because the
data is divided vertically among many tables. This allows them to
perform better as they are small enough to get fit into the buffer.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">The updates
are very fast because the data to be updated is located at a single
place and there are no duplicates.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Similarly
the inserts are very fast because the data has to be inserted at a
single place and does not have to be duplicated.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">The selects
are fast in cases where data has to be fetched from a single table,
because normally normalized tables are small enough to get fit into
the buffer.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Because the
data is not duplicated so there is less need for heavy duty group by
or distinct queries.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Although
there seems to be much in favor of normalized tables, with all the
pros outlined above, but the main cause of concern with fully
normalized tables is that normalized data means joins between tables.
And this joining means that read operations have to suffer because
indexing strategies do not go well with table joins.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Now lets
have a look at the pros and cons of a denormalized database design.</span></i></pre>

</pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Pros and
cons of denormalized database design.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Denormalized
databases fair well under heavy read-load and when the application is
read intensive. This is because of the following reasons:</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">The data is
present in the same table so there is no need for any joins, hence
the selects are very fast.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">A single
table with all the required data allows much more efficient index
usage. If the columns are indexed properly, then results can be
filtered and sorted by utilizing the same index. While in the case of
a normalized table, since the data would be spread out in different
tables, this would not be possible.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Although
for reasons mentioned above selects can be very fast on denormalized
tables, but because the data is duplicated, the updates and inserts
become complex and costly.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Having said
that neither one of the approach can be entirely neglected, because a
real world application is going to have both read-loads and
write-loads. Hence the correct way would be to utilize both the
normalized and denormalized approaches depending on situations.</span></i></pre>
