this applies to formatting, using braces, naming (variables, classes,

somewhere under /css I'm coming after you with a machete);</span></i></font></pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Size:
if a function doesn't fit in its entirety on the screen in a normal
IDE at a normal font size then you need a pretty darn good reason as
to why not. Of course there are some valid cases for much longer
functions but they are greatly outweighed by the egregious examples.
Decompose as necessary to keep your functions simple;</span></i></font></pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Comment
Judiciously: there is a tendency for some programmers to use comments
as a substitute for readable code or to simply comment for the sake
of commenting (like /* finished */ comments right before return
true;. Seriously, what's the point? Most (good) code explains itself;</span></i></font></pre>

Cut and Paste Within a Project: it's perfectly acceptable to take a
code snippet from one project to another (every project is an island)
but you should never take a non-trivial code segment from within one
project to some other point within the project. Inevitably one
changes and you leave some poor developer with the task of looking at
these two or more code segments trying to work out how (and arguably
more importantly, why) they are different; and</span></i></font></pre>

Repetitive Code: if you find yourself writing the same sequence of
statements (or very similar) over and over again, abstract or
parameterize it. If you see very similar statements the tendency is
to skim over them assuming they're all the same (when typically they
won't be in a way that matters).</span></i></font></pre>

fact do need to have a PHP process in memory even if the connection
is passive, but this is not the case if you run PHP as FastCGI.
Apache can also handle lots of passive connections if you run PHP as

because of its very structure. Most internet applications are

for such scripts. In CGI, a HTTP request generally causes the
invocation of a new process on the server, but FastCGI, SCGI and
other approaches improved the mechanism, raising the performance,

better than running as mod_php, but it depends on your requirements
and is also a little more complex; in this configuration, permission,
processes related stuff &amp; everything is run under PHP
configuration, PHP user etc. &amp; Apache connects to PHP as to a
server; in this configuration it is also possible to have pool of PHP
servers and to have PHP server on physically different machine than

<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><span style="font-weight: normal">A
tightly coupled architecture integrates enterprise applications
around a single point of truth, which is often a single
spatially-enabled RDBMS. The types of applications that are linked
include engineering design (CAD), facility records management (GIS),
asset management, workflow, ERP, CRM, outage management, and other
enterprise applications.</span></font></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><span style="font-weight: normal">A
major advantage of a tightly coupled architecture is that it enables
the rapid and efficient processing of large volumes of data, provides
a single point of truth instead of several, often redundant, data
sources, and enables open access to data throughout the organization.</span></font></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><span style="font-weight: normal">Tightly
coupled architectures rely on standards such as SQL, ODBC, JDBC, and
OLEDB, SQL/MM, and the Simple Feature Specification for SQL from the
OGC, to provide open and secure access to data, including geo-spatial
data, throughout the organization.</span></font></pre>

<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">You're
right yes. The architecture of a system is its 'skeleton'. It's the
highest level of abstraction of a system. What kind of data storage
is present, how do modules interact with each other, what recovery
systems are in place. Just like design patterns, there are
architectural patterns: MVC, 3-tier layered design, etc.</span></i></font></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Software
design is about designing the individual modules / components. What
are the responsibilities, functions, of module x? Of class Y? What
can it do, and what not? What design patterns can be used?</span></i></font></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">So
in short, Software architecture is more about the design of the
entire system, while software design emphasizes on module / component
/ class level.</span></i></font></pre>

some descriptions of the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) they
are interchangeable, but the consesus is that they are distinct. They
are at the same time: different (1) stages, (2) areas of
responsibility, and (3) levels of decision-making.</span></i></font></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Architecture
is the bigger picture: the choice of frameworks, languages, scope,
goals, and high-level methodologies (Rational, waterfall, agile,
etc.).</span></i></font></pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Design
is the smaller picture: the plan for how code will be organized; how
the contracts between different parts of the system will look; the
ongoing implementation of the project's methodologies and goals.
Specification are written during this stage.</span></i></font></pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">These
two stages will seem to blend together for different reasons.</span></i></font></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Smaller
projects often don't have enough scope to separate out planning into
these to stages.</span></i></font></pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">A
project might be a part of a larger project, and hence parts of both
stages are already decided. (There are already existing databases,
conventions, standards, protocols, frameworks, reusable code, etc.)</span></i></font></pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Newer
ways of thinking about the SDLC (see Agile methodologies) somewhat
rearrange this traditional approach. Design (architecture to a lesser
extent) takes place throughout the SDLC on purpose. There are often
more iterations where the whole process happens over and over.</span></i></font></pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Software
development is complicated and difficult to plan anyway, but
clients/managers/salespeople usually make it harder by changing goals
and requirements mid-stream. Design and even architectural decisions
must bemade later in the project whether that is the plan or not.</span></i></font></pre>
<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Even
if the stages or areas of responsibility blend together and happen
all over the place, it is always good to know what level of
decision-making is happening. (We could go on forever with this. I'm
trying to keep it a summary.) I'll end with: Even if it seems your
project has no formal architectural or design
stage/AOR/documentaiton, it IS happening whether anyone is
consciously doing it or not. If no one decides to do architecture,
then a default one happens that is probably poor. Ditto for design.
These concepts are almost more important if there are no formal
stages representing them.</span></i></font></pre>
