all of the servers (you, me, your neighbor) know the truth (that it's

<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">The reason
why so many NoSQL systems have eventual consistency is that virtually
all of them are designed to be distributed, and with fully
distributed systems there is super-linear overhead to maintaining
strict consistency (meaning you can only scale so far before things
start to slow down, and when they do you need to throw exponentially
more hardware at the problem to keep scaling).</span></i></pre>

<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">noSQL
databases give up a massive amount of functionality that a SQL
database gives you by it's very nature.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Things like
automatic enforcement of referential integrity, transactions, etc.
These are all things that are very handy to have for some problems,
and which require some interesting techniques to scale outside of a
single server (think about what happens if you need to lock two
tables for an atomic transaction, and they are on different
servers!).</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">noSQL
databases don't have all that. If you need that stuff, you need to do
it yourself, but if you DON'T need it (and there are a lot of
applications that don't), then boy howdy are you in luck. The DB
doesn't have to do all of these complex operations and locking across
much of the dataset, so it's really easy to partition the thing
across many servers/disks/whatever and have it work really fast.</span></i></pre>
