<pre class="western">[↑] Questions about Design Patterns:</pre>
<pre class="western">Q. Why are global and static objects evil? Can
you show it with a code example?</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">To elaborate, imagine you have a couple of
objects that both use the same global variable. Assuming you're not
using a source of randomness anywhere within either module, then the
output of a particular method can be predicted (and therefore tested)
if the state of the system is known before you execute the method.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">However, if a method in one of the objects
triggers a side effect which changes the value of the shared global
state, then you no longer know what the starting state is when you
execute a method in the other object. You can now no longer predict
what output you'll get when you execute the method, and therefore you
can't test it.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Tell me about Inversion of Control and how does
it improve the design of code?</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">The Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency
Injection (DI) patterns are all about removing dependencies from your
code.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">For example, say your application has a text
editor component and you want to provide spell checking. Your
standard code would look something like this:</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">public class TextEditor {</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">    private SpellChecker checker;</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">    public TextEditor() {</pre>
<pre class="western">        this.checker = new SpellChecker();</pre>
<pre class="western">    }</pre>
<pre class="western">}</pre>

<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Q. The Law of Demeter (the Principle of Least
Knowledge) states that each unit should have only limited knowledge
about other units and it should only talk to its immediate friends
(sometimes stated as &quot;Don't talk to strangers&quot;). Would you
write code violating this principle, show why it is a bad design and
then fix it?</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">In many programming languages, all returned
values are objects. As others have said, not being able to use the
methods of returned objects forces you to never return anything at
all. You should be asking your self, &quot;What are the
responsibilities of class A, B and C?&quot; This is why using
metasyntactic variable names like A, B and C always solicit the
answer &quot;it depends&quot; because there is no inherit
responsibilities in those terms.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">You may want to look into Domain Driven Design,
which will give you a more nuanced set of heuristics to reason about
where functionality should go and who should be invoking what.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Your second question concerning immutable
objects speaks to the notion of a</pre>
<pre class="western">Value Object compared to an Entity object. in
DDD, You can pass value objects around with almost no restrictions.
This does not speak true for entity objects.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">The simplistic LOD is much better expressed in
DDD as the rules for accessing Aggregates. No external objects should
hold references to members of aggregates. Only a root reference
should be held.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">DDD aside, you at least want to develop your own
sets of stereotypes for your classes that are reasonable for your
domain. Enforce rules about those stereotypes as you design your
system.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Also always remember that all of these rules are
to manage complexity, not to hamstring yourself.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Q. Active-Record is the design pattern that
promotes objects to include functions such as Insert, Update, and
Delete, and properties that correspond to the columns in some
underlying database table. In your opinion and experience, which are
the limits and pitfalls of the this pattern?</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">The main drawback is your &quot;entities&quot;
are aware of their own persistence which leads to a lot of other bad
design decisions.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">The other issues is that most active record
toolkits basically map 1 to 1 to table fields with zero layers of
indirection. This works on small scales but falls apart when you have
trickier problems to solve.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Well, having your objects know about their
persistence means you need to do things like:</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">easily have database connections available
everywhere. This typically leads to nasty hardcoding or some sort of
static connection that gets hit from everywhere.</pre>
<pre class="western">your objects tend to look more like SQL than
objects.</pre>
<pre class="western">hard to do anything in the app disconnected
because database is so ingrained.</pre>
<pre class="western">There ends up being a whole slew of other bad
decisions on top of this.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>

<pre class="western">Q.Why it is often said that the introduction of
null is a &quot;Billion dollar mistake&quot;? Would you discuss the
techniques to avoid it, such as the Null Object Pattern introduced by
the GOF book, or Option types?</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">null is evil</pre>
<pre class="western">There is a presentation on InfoQ on this topic:
Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake by Tony Hoare</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Option type</pre>
<pre class="western">The alternative from functional programming is
using an Option type, that can contain SOME value or NONE.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">A good article The “Option” Pattern that
discuss the Option type and provide an implementation of it for Java.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">I have also found a bug-report for Java about
this issue: Add Nice Option types to Java to prevent
NullPointerExceptions. The requested feature was introduced in Java
8.</pre>

<pre class="western">Q. Many state that, in Object-Oriented
Programming, Composition is often a better option than Inheritance.
What's you opinion?</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">down vote</pre>
<pre class="western">TL;DR</pre>
<pre class="western">Attempting to use composition first, before
attempting to use inheritance, prevents naive mistakes. Also, Class
Inheritance:</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Is easy to misuse.</pre>
<pre class="western">Is less versatile than composition.</pre>
<pre class="western">Is less versatile than interface inheritance.</pre>
<pre class="western">Requires more maintenance than composition.</pre>
<pre class="western">Provides some good guarantees about the derived
types. Consider if it is worth the points above.</pre>
<pre class="western">Should be used when we need to follow the Liskov
substitution principle.</pre>
<pre class="western">Can be necesary to extend poorly designed third
party systems. Blame the third party.</pre>
<pre class="western">Also, Java is not perfect.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>

</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Q. What is an Anti-corruption Layer?</pre>
<pre class="western">Isolate the different subsystems by placing an
anti-corruption layer between them. This layer translates
communications between the two systems, allowing one system to remain
unchanged while the other can avoid compromising its design and
technological approach.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Q.The ability to change implementation without
affecting clients is called Data Abstraction. Produce and example
violating this property, then fix it.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Q Write a snippet of code violating the Don't
Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. Then, fix it.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">it is just called duplicate code - I don't know
of any more fancy names for this. The long term consequences are as
you described, and worse.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Of course, eliminating the duplication is the
ideal option if only possible. It may take a lot of time (in a recent
case in our legacy project, I had several methods duplicated across
more than 20 subclasses in a class hierarchy, many of which had
evolutionarily grown their own slight differences / extensions over
the years. It took me about 1,5 years through successive unit test
writing and refactoring to get rid of all duplications. Perseverance
was worth it though).</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">In such a case, you may still need one or more
of the other options as temporary fixes, even if you decide to start
moving towards eliminating the duplication. However, which of those
is better depends on a lot of factors, and without more context we
are just guessing.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Lots of small improvements can make a big
difference in the long run. You don't necessarily need the customer's
explicit approval for these either - a little refactoring every time
when you touch said class to fix a bug or implement a feature can go
a long way over time. Just include some extra time for refactoring in
your task estimates. It is just like standard maintenance to keep the
software healthy in the long run.</pre>

</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Q How would you deal with Dependency Hell?</pre>
<pre class="western">This problem is almost always caused by using
unspecific version numbers in your composer.json, or relying on
&quot;dev-master&quot; for too many requirements.  While it may work
on the day you set up your project, as each project undergoes further
development the chance increases that the head commit will introduce
an incompatibility.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">The only 100% sure way to avoid this is to use
specific version tags for your requirements.  By specifying exact
version numbers, each time you run &quot;composer update&quot; you're
getting the versions that you developed and tested against.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">If you've already gone ahead and set up your
requirements using dev-master or loose versioning (e.g. &quot;~1.0.*&quot;),
you could manually work through your composer.json to resolve the
version numbers by hand.  That will take some time, but you will end
up with a cleaner and more reliable set of requirements.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Q Is goto evil? You may have heard of the famous
paper &quot;Go To Statement Considered Harmful&quot; by Edsger
Dijkstra, in which he criticized the use of the goto statement and
advocated structured programming instead. The use of goto has always
been controversial, so much that even Dijkstra's letter was
criticized with articles such as &quot;'GOTO Considered Harmful'
Considered Harmful&quot;. What's your opinion on the use of goto?</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Unless you are programming in assembler, GOTO
should always be treated the same way as the life vest of the
airplanes: it is good to have them available, but if you need to use
them it means that you are in big trouble.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Q. Separation of Concerns is a design principle
for separating a computer program into distinct areas, each of ones
addressing a separate concern. There are a lot of different
mechanisms for achieving Separation of Concerns (use of objects,
functions, modules, or patterns such as MVC and the like). Would you
discuss this topic?</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Well, like doing many things in life, it always
helpful to be well organized. Models, Views and Controllers are
distinctly different pieces of code that helps to provide different
functions to your overall project. Because of that, they are kept
separate and organized.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">Imagine if you were designing a program. You
wouldn't put all your code into one function, would you? No, you
would divide them up into separate smaller functions that solve very
specific tasks. Likewise, as programmers, we're constantly looking
for ways to separate and divide our large applications to smaller
bits of pieces. One of these organization design patterns is MVC,
where, the model (the data) exists in one section, the view (the UI)
exist in one section, and the controller (logic) exists in another
section.</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">What problems does this solve? Well, just as how
having separated functions solve the problems of readability,
modularity, and coupling, so does MVC. Say if you wanted to change a
piece of code, you can tackle it in a smaller subset that is more or
less isolated from the larger piece of code. This allows you to add,
modify or remove code more effeciently and logically. It also helps
in testing, since similar code is sectioned into groups, you may be
able to have better coverage of your tests cases. Also very important
is that you end up writing a lot less code.</pre>
