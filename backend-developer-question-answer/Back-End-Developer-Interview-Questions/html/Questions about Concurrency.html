<pre class="western"><b>Why do we need Concurrency, anyway? Explain.</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Simple.
Imagine two users try to modify same data in different ways at the
same time, and then the other user wants to access the data. What
happens afterwards is anyone’s guess.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">There is no
way to apply their changes to the same data and same place. If DBMS
allows both of their actions concurrently, it would be impossible to
recognize which data is updated. Or, if DBMS choose one of the
changes, the other one becomes meaningless. Then, it is sure to
affect the results and confuses users as well since there is no error
message or notification for this issue. Both of solutions make the
database inconsistent and useless. This is why concurrency control is
needed.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Actually,
there is no “same time actions” in Computer Science so DBMS
accepts one request and blocks or rejects the other one. This is the
simplest way to make database concurrent. Most relational DBMS
supports this function.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">But it
decrease performance of concurrent tasks because one task may be
blocked by other one and in waiting status until it finished (and
because it controls “concurrency”, literally!). Control of data
concurrency and data consistency is critical as concurrent data
execution need to produce meaningful and consistent results. If you
don't need data to be updated consistently or you don't have any plan
for UPDATE operation on that data but you want to do concurrent tasks
quickly, you can choose DBMS product that supports disabling
concurrency control or optimized only for concurrent</span></i></pre>

<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><b>Why is testing multithreading / concurrent
code so difficult?</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">If you can
count on any mathematical experience, illustrate how a normal
execution flow that is essentially deterministic becomes not just
nondeterministic with several threads, but exponentially complex,
because you have to make sure every possible interleaving of machine
instructions will still do the right thing. A simple example of a
lost update or dirty read situation is often an eye-opener.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">&quot;Slap
a lock on it&quot; is the trivial solution... it solves all your
problems if you're not concerned about performance. Try to illustrate
how much of a performance hit it would be if, for instance, Amazon
had to lock the entire east coast whenever someone in Atlanta orders
one book!</span></i></pre>

<pre class="western"><b>What is a Race Condition? Code an example,
using whatever language you like.</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">A race
condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and
they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling
algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the
order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data.
Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the
thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are &quot;racing&quot;
to access/change the data.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Problems
often occur when one thread does a &quot;check-then-act&quot; (e.g.
&quot;check&quot; if the value is X, then &quot;act&quot; to do
something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does
something to the value in between the &quot;check&quot; and the
&quot;act&quot;. E.g:</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">if (x == 5)
// The &quot;Check&quot;</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">{</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western">   <i><span style="font-weight: normal">y = x *
2; // The &quot;Act&quot;</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western">   <i><span style="font-weight: normal">// If
another thread changed x in between &quot;if (x == 5)&quot; and &quot;y
= x * 2&quot; above,</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western">   <i><span style="font-weight: normal">// y
will not be equal to 10.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">}</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">The point
being, y could be 10, or it could be anything, depending on whether
another thread changed x in between the check and act. You have no
real way of knowing.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">In order to
prevent race conditions from occurring, you would typically put a
lock around the shared data to ensure only one thread can access the
data at a time. This would mean something like this:</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">// Obtain
lock for x</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">if (x == 5)</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">{</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western">   <i><span style="font-weight: normal">y = x *
2; // Now, nothing can change x until the lock is released. </span></i>
</pre>
<pre class="western">              <i><span style="font-weight: normal">//
Therefore y = 10</span></i></pre>

lock for x</span></i></pre>

<pre class="western"><b>What is a Deadlock? Would you be able to
write some code that is affected by deadlocks?</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><b>What is Process Starvation? If you need,
let's review its definition.</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">A lock
occurs when multiple processes try to access the same resource at the
same time.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">One process
loses out and must wait for the other to finish.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">A deadlock
occurs when the waiting process is still holding on to another
resource that the first needs before it can finish.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">So, an
example:</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Resource A
and resource B are used by process X and process Y</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">X starts to
use A.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">X and Y try
to start using B</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Y 'wins'
and gets B first</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">now Y needs
to use A</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">A is locked
by X, which is waiting for Y</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">The best
way to avoid deadlocks is to avoid having processes cross over in
this way. Reduce the need to lock anything as much as you can.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">In
databases avoid making lots of changes to different tables in a
single transaction, avoid triggers and switch to
optimistic/dirty/nolock reads as much as possible.</span></i></pre>

<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><b>What is a Wait Free algorithm</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">If a
program is lock-free, it basically means that at least one of its
threads is guaranteed to make progress over an arbitrary period of
time. If a program deadlocks, none of its threads (and therefore the
program as a whole) cannot make progress - we can say it's not
lock-free. Since lock-free programs are guaranteed to make progress,
they are guaranteed to complete (assuming finite execution without
exceptions).</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Wait-free
is a stronger condition which means that every thread is guaranteed
to make progress over an arbitrary period of time, regardless of the
timing/ordering of thread execution; and so we can say that the
threads finish independently. All wait-free programs are lock-free.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">I don't
know offhand of any Java examples which illustrate this but I can
tell you that lock-free/wait-free programs are typically implemented
without locks, using low-level primitives such as CAS instructions.</span></i></pre>
