<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">You can
roll your own, but you probably will make a major security mistake if
you are not an expert in security/cryptography or have had your
scheme analyzed by multiple experts. I'm more willing to bet on an
open-source publicly known encryption scheme that's out there for all
to see and analyze. More eyes means more likely that the current
version doesn't have major vulnerabilities, as opposed to something
developed in-house by non-experts.</span></i></pre>

</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">When I was
in college in the early 70s, I devised what I believed was a
brilliant encryption scheme. A simple pseudorandom number stream was
added to the plaintext stream to create ciphertext. This would
seemingly thwart any frequency analysis of the ciphertext, and would
be uncrackable even to the most resourceful government intelligence
agencies. I felt so smug about my achievement.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Years
later, I discovered this same scheme in several introductory
cryptography texts and tutorial papers. How nice. Other
cryptographers had thought of the same scheme. Unfortunately, the
scheme was presented as a simple homework assignment on how to use
elementary cryptanalytic techniques to trivially crack it. So much
for my brilliant scheme.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">From this
humbling experience I learned how easy it is to fall into a false
sense of security when devising an encryption algorithm. Most people
donâ€™t realize how fiendishly difficult it is to devise an
encryption algorithm that can withstand a prolonged and determined
attack by a resourceful opponent.</span></i></pre>

risk of logs containing sensitive information, such as passwords. How
would you deal with this?</b></pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">There are
several best practices that you should consider when dealing with
sensitive data.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">First of
all, minimize all of the sensitive data that you transfer at all. By
hashing the password as early as possible in the architecture, you
can ensure that any downstream components never even run the risk of
exposing sensitive data.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Second,
which is associated to the prior point, you should constrain/isolate
the components that ever receive this sensitive information. For a
password, only the authentication server would ever need this
information - the rest of the components should really only deal with
an authorization token (or something of the same ilk.) With regards
to a credit card, this should likely only ever be associated with
those services that would ever need it - for example the
checkout/billing component of your system.</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Third, for
those systems that actually do need to get the actual value of the
sensitive information for logic (e.g. credit card), you should
consider creating/using a token-like system. This would basically be
a place where you can store the sensitive information and provide an
ID reference that replaces the original sensitive data element (e.g.
exchange a credit card number for a credit card number id).</span></i></pre>
<pre class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br>
</pre>
<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">To close
out the solution, exchange the sensitive data as close to the edge as
possible (e.g. where you captured the credit card) in exchange for
this token. Exchange this token for the sensitive information value
(with the right authorization) to get the value back and then use it
at the very latest possible moment. Finally, audit the logging that
is done at those sensitive points to make sure that it's not logged
in the clear.</span></i></pre>

<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious
scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS
attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send
malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a
different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are
quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from
a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding
it.</span></i></pre>

<pre class="western"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">An attacker
can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The
end userâ€™s browser has no way to know that the script should not be
trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script
came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any
cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by
the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite
the content of the HTML page. For more details on the different types
of XSS flaws, see: Types of Cross-Site Scripting.</span></i></pre>
