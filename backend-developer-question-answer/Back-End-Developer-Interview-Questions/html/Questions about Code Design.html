the index is used as an offset. The first element of the array is
exactly contained in the memory location that array refers (0

<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">In
some cases of extreme optimization, you might be using techniques
that makes it difficult for someone to follow what your code is
doing. In these cases, comments can and should be used to not only
explain why you have such optimizations, but what the code is doing.
A good rule of thumb would be to have someone else (or multiple other
people) familiar with the implementation language and project look at
your code - if they can't understand both the why and the how, then

<pre class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">However,
what's not clear in the code is why you have done something. If you
take an approach that might not be obvious to others, you should have
a comment that explains why you made the decisions that you did. I
would suspect that you might not even realize that a comment is
needed until after something like a code review, where people want to
know why you did X instead of Y - you can capture your answer in the
code for everyone else who looks at it in the future.</span></i></font></pre>

right yes. The architecture of a system is its 'skeleton'. It's the
highest level of abstraction of a system. What kind of data storage
is present, how do modules interact with each other, what recovery
systems are in place. Just like design patterns, there are
architectural patterns: MVC, 3-tier layered design, etc.</span></i></font></pre>
