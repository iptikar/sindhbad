1. Alots of plugines is avialble fir example i would like to add influxdb then 
by running following command 

[grafana-cli plugins install grafana-influxdb-08-datasource] 

i can install influxdb plugine

After installing all three components i influxdb was unable to restart so  and check the 
syslog file and found 

: run: open server: open service: Stat(): stat /usr/local/share/collectd: no such file or directory

which is set in /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf [[collectd]] line 

file was not there i have create and influxdb started to work.


> While connection to influxdb and creating data source got error collectd database not found 
Ans I need to create database get request is not allowed to create database therefore i have 
send curl request 

=================================================================
$url = 'http://localhost:8086/query';

$ch = curl_init();

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,
            "q=CREATE+DATABASE+collectd");

// In real life you should use something like:
// curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, 
//          http_build_query(array('postvar1' => 'value1')));

// Receive server response ...
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$server_output = curl_exec($ch);

curl_close ($ch);

// Further processing ...
if ($server_output == "OK") { 
	
} else { }

echo $server_output;
